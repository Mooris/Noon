# Noon
A wannabe midi splitter/merger for macOS using CoreMIDI

Right now it just list your midi interfaces and if one have 4 output it will forward all inputs sent to "Noon endpoint" to these 4 output

The main motivation of this project is because reason wants to send the clock on only one input, my midisport 4x4 could not re-route midi data and I was too lazy to find a solution, grabbed Xcode and opened the CoreMIDI documentation.

Btw Midi is the french for Noon, now you now why that name. Cocorico b*tch.

#### TODO List:

  - Add checkboxes and things that appear on screen and not in teh terminal (What a weird stuff)
  - Refactor
  - Test it
  - Understand CoreMIDI
  - Refactor
